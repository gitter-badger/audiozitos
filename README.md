# Auidozitos ðŸ”‰

Audiozitos is a audio recoder designed to be fast, simple and stressless.

We're still developing the app, but we gonna publish experimental versions ASAP. âš¡

## Main goals

~We're working to complete them all.~

- Be fast.
- Be free.
- Record good quality audio.
- Friendly UI.
- No blocking steps when using the app, everything should be fluid.

## Why Open Source?

Because we would gladly contribute to other apps to improve'em and get a better recording experience, but they're all closed, so we decided to create our own app and make it open for everyone to contribute with us. â™¥

We don't want money for this, we just want to create a great app for everyone. However we got a cost to make these things, so donaions ~(when you can't contribute with the source)~ are always welcome. ðŸŒˆ
